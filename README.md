Fourment M. & Holmes E.C. Avian influenza virus exhibits distinct evolutionary dynamics in wild birds and poultry. *BMC Evolutionary Biology*, 2015, 15:120; doi: 10.1186/s12862-015-0410-5.

Each FASTA file contains a nucleotide alignment:

* H4-PA.fa, H4-PB1.fa, and H4-PB2.fa contain H4 internal genes isolated from wild birds only.
* H6-PA.fa, H6-PB1.fa, and H6-PB2.fa contain H6 internal genes isolated from wild birds only.
* H5-poultry-PA.fa, H5-poultry-PB1.fa, and H5-poultry-PB2.fa contain H5 internal genes isolated from poultry (i.e. turkey and chicken) only.
* H6-poultry-PA.fa, H6-poultry-PB1.fa, and H6-poultry-PB2.fa contain H6 internal genes isolated from poultry (i.e. turkey and chicken) only.
